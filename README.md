# DevOps Coding Mentorship

This repo is a personal initiative to help DevOps Engineers to write more code. If you want to participate
as a mentor or mentee, read the project [requirements](#requirements), then view the
[central task board](https://github.com/aabouzaid/devops-coding-mentorship/projects?query=is%3Aopen).

## Why?

Many DevOps engineers come from Ops backgrounds or have just started their careers;
however, they still don't write much code!

As SRE or DevOps Engineer without good coding skills, you will be constrained, limited, and missing many opportunities.

Coding is the optimal solution for numerous challenges, but also it's crucial to recognize that
coding may not always be the most effective approach. Deciding the suitability of the solution requires proficient
coding skills.

## How?

The idea is simple, as a senior SE or DevOps, you usually stumbled upon some bugs and features in open-source projects,
and even if you know how to fix/do them, you typically don't have enough time for that.

Each mentor will list a couple of open-source projects they know well, and the mentee will create a pull request
(or an issue if it's not there) with the proposed solution.

In other words, this is a `task-based` mentorship initiative.

## Requirements

- **As a mentor:** You should have good knowledge of the open-source project you suggest,
  communication skills, and coding proficiency.
- **As a mentee:** You should already write code and know the language's syntax
  (this initiative is not for someone writing code for the first time!).

## Participation

How to participate in this initiative? You could be a mentor or mentee or even both!

### Mentor

- As a mentor, you select an open-source tool/project with which you know or families
  (it's recommended to be related to the DevOps toolkit).
- You know a bug or missing feature in that tool/project, and you have a general idea of how to fix it
  (**it's better to discuss the feature/fix with the upstream project before working on it**).
- Create [an issue in this repo](https://github.com/aabouzaid/devops-coding-mentorship/issues)
  with all details about the task, the language, the difficulty, etc.
- One of the mentees who is interested in the topic/language will show an interest in that task.
- Finally, you and the mentee will pair together (meet, call, text, as you like) to work on that task.

### Mentee

- Find an interesting task for you (based on the topic, language, or difficulty) in the
  [central task board](https://github.com/aabouzaid/devops-coding-mentorship/projects?query=is%3Aopen).
- The mentors will support and guide you in that task, depending on the programming language,
  syntax, and tools used.

## Notes

This initiative is at an early stage, and the flow will get better over time.
Hence, all feedback is more than welcome.
